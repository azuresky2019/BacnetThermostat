modify negative icon for top temperature displaying.
fixed relay pwm output percentage 2

rev 8_4
fix bacnet AV12 system mode value and display bug.
fix input 4-20mA range when current is over 17mA, data over flow issue. 

rev8_3
fix when use register 101 & 691 to change the cool/heat mode, it will write wrong value to register 113(cool/heat config)
 rev8_2
 fixed cycle delay and change over delay 
 modify co2 filter, before it dose not work.
 modify complier level to solve rev3 relays problem(relay4 will be on when power up and relay1 to 3 can not be controled)
 add new register 693 to clear all eeprom except serial number and ID and set to factory default settings.

 rev8_1
 T7: fixed fan mode when press decrese key, it not go to off mode
 T7: fixed cool/heat mode when switch mode the display always show heat.
 redefine keypad function for fan mode setpoint and sys mode
 left key: selec items up way
 right key: select items down way
 up and down key: adjust current selected item.

 rev8_0
 add new humidity sensor sht3x
 rec 7_9
 1.add ptransfer function so can read/write registers under MSTP protocol by T3000.
 rev7_8
 tstat7 fixed canot read temperature from hum sensor bug

 rev7_7
1.	When input range set to 4-20mA, customer table1 and customer2, send data in float mode for bacnet
2.	Fixed when using priority to change analog outputs, the value in register not change bug.
3.	Fixed when using customer table2, 2.5V and 3V point do not save properly issue.  

 rev7_6
 fix when deadmaster is set, after power off to on, the timer is not initialized bug.
  rev7_5
  for tstst7:
  change refresh outputs task to 50ms peroid
  add ID check before deal with serial data to make system faster, when too many polling data on the bus, this can save time.

 rev7_4
 fixed Tstat7 keypad no response bug. the inputs initial routine is overflow.

 rev7_3
 modify register209 write operation, before it also store in other 5 place, now just store in one position and if current data is equal to last one, do not change it to reduce the dual with time.

 rev7_2
 add  protect function for modbus  command, if last read/write command is not done, do not receive new command to avoid receive buffer been changed by wrong.  
 add debug code to count how many times it receive change ID command and store the last commad to EEPROM 
 modify schedule so can match for yabe and T3000
 add time synchronization 

 rev71
 fixed icon control when only set one of heat or cool icon relative with output, another one will not work at normal state.
 add color indicator for Vicente

 rev7_0
 modify 10V input formular, previous it can not up to 10V.

 rev6_9 add customer table 0-10V range
 REV6_8
 fixed instance number for bacnet protocol, before only take low 16 bits of serial number as default value.
 fixed clock function for AI, and for occupancy sensor function, when singal is on, it will trigger override timer.  
 REV6_7
 add voltage check function for rs485 lins
 remap GPIO pins for AI
 rev6_6
 fixed occupancy sensor function for AI, before only AI1 and AI2 can work.
 add priority array for AO and BO 
 rev 6_5
 add float value for temperature humidity and setpoint for bacnet
 rev6_4 test version.
 rev6_3 fix after change protocol from modbus to bacnet, the object name not initial problem.
 rev6_2 modify Tstat7 when it is in coast mode, stop the fan blade.
 rev6_1 fixed after update firmware, ID and serial number not read right problem.
 rev6_0
 store modbus ID and serial number in flash, not in the eeprom 

 rev5_6
 2017-11-22
 add icon output control function: reg783 to reg791,all 9 icons:day,night,occ,unocc,heat,cool,fanspeed1,fanspeed2,fanspeed3
 reduce the send/receive icon hold time.
 change the sun/moon icons make them clear.
 modify sun/moon icon for hotel and office mode 


 rev5_5 
 fixed RTC single write bug.
 fixed analog input function, value 2: occupancy sensor, before it dose not work.

 rev5_4
 fixed clock time multiple write fucntion, before it is not standar modbus command
 modify clock year value write command, compatible with Tstat6, for example, if write 2017, just write 17 to the register, before need write 2017.


 rev 5_3
 modify code to compatible with hardware rev3 and hardware rev4, now only one hex file.

 rev5_2
 2017-07-20 using new bacnet librery rev10, fixed when send write command by yabe software, unit response abort message. reason: BACNET_MAX_PRIORITY must set to 16

 rev4_9
 using new bacnet lib rev8

 rev4_8
 tstat7 modify occ/unocc button, before it dose not work well
 bacnet station number can not be more than 50, bacnet library need to be fixed.temperary set it to 50 for this version.

 use new fan icons.
 rev3_9
 2017-01-18
 adjust the display order for baudrate select
 fixed degree C/F icon for the top unit degree.

 2017-01-17
 fixed when write current degree with the same degree, it still do the converter math bug.
 fixed output1 function can not be read/write problem, because it has the same low byte with scan command.

 fixed override time saving problem
 add pir function, adjust pir judge threshold and add pir sensetivity register  
 add show ID command

 rev3_3
 fix srand/rand routine error
 add reset command to reset zigbee module after serial communication failure 1 minute 

 rev2_6
 cc 2016

 rev2_5
 cc 2016-04-21 fixed bug when set one cool or one heat stage, when pid result over 50%, it go to coast stage by wrong.	(pid library has been changed, OutputValue() routine modified)


 REV 2_4
 2016-3-31
 cc modify change baudrate function, in dealwith data routine, set a flag and response the command, then switch baudrate outside, so T3000 know if tstat accept this command
 cc fix a bug that fan auto table can not be changed.

 2016-3-17 cc 
 ---modify baudrate keypad select, after change the baudrate by keypad, system dose not restart.
 ---modify bacnet library rev2 

 REV 2_3
 2016-03-11 cc ---modify dealwithTag, make it logger, so do not response serial command too fast, otherwise minipannel will receive wrong values
 							---when initial tstat8 name, write all 20 charactors


 REV 2_2
 2016-03-09 cc modify control logic routine, use ram variables instead of read_eeprom(), during task switch, read_eeprom() function sometimes return wrong value, so 
 	 outputs will be wrong 

 REV2_1
 CC fixed digital output, add relay switch time to softtimer routine 

 REV 1
 cc 07-07-2015
 add firmware version
